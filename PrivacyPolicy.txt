- Read daily step totals (if you grant permission)
- Write walking exercise sessions and steps recorded during sessions (if you grant permission)

Data handling:
- Health data from Health Connect is used **only** for app functionality and is **not** shared with third parties.
- No data is sold.
- You can revoke Health Connect permissions at any time in the Health Connect app.
- You can sign out to remove your local profile, and clear app data to remove local storage.
